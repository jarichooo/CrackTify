Building this crack detection app was frustrating, and I encountered numerous errors, which I had to resolve multiple times in order to get a component of the app to work. Debugging was very challenging, as I had to iterate through the process multiple times in a debugging cycle and rethink how the server was trying to process the information while ensuring that the UI remained functional and smooth. I had to iterate a few times to regain a proper workflow.

Balancing my responsibilities as a UI/UX designer and a server developer made the process even more challenging. On one hand, I had to ensure the interface felt intuitive, engaging, and meaningful. On the other, I had to maintain server reliability, performance, and clean backend logic. Finding that balance wasn’t always easy, but every error taught me something new. Through this experience, along with my group, I made an application that not only complied with the requirements for the course, but also solved a real-world problem in infrastructure.
