Creating this application has been an incredibly challenging yet rewarding journey. From the start, I faced steep learning curves with **Flet** for building the GUI and integrating a **machine learning model**. Implementing MobileNet and training it with my own dataset taught me about the nuances of model preparation, data handling, and the patience required to achieve accurate results.

One of the biggest challenges was navigating **Git and GitHub**. Learning to stage, commit, and push changes properly, and understanding the differences between tracked, untracked, and staged files, required persistence and careful attention. Reading and understanding **other people’s code** was also tough, as deciphering someone else’s logic—especially when poorly documented—tested my patience and analytical skills.

My team and I also attempted to integrate a **camera function** for the mobile version of the app. However, due to the complexity of real-time camera integration and the limited time left, we decided to revert to a **desktop application**. This decision taught us an important lesson about prioritizing functionality and project scope while still aiming for a usable, effective product.

Despite all the challenges, completing this application gave me a real sense of accomplishment. I gained hands-on experience in **GUI development, machine learning integration, and version control**, and I now feel more confident tackling complex projects. This journey wasn’t just about building an app; it was about learning how to learn, adapt, and persist through difficulties—skills that will be invaluable in my future as a developer.
